#### 06/05/2022 Questions
1. First Question was just to tell them a little about myself
2. Asked about the roles & responsibilities of current project being worked on
3. Asked to describe my P2 to them, like describe the overall application and whats function is
4. Why Strings in Java are immutable?
   * An immutable object is an object whose internal state remains constant after it has been entirely created. 
   * https://www.baeldung.com/java-string-immutable
   * The key benefits of keeping this class as immutable are 
     * caching, 
     * security, 
     * synchronization, 
     * and performance.
   * ![](string.png)
5. What Angular AOT compiler is?
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h_zSpjL4TY
   * AOT
     * Ahead of time compilation
     * compiles the application just in time in the broswer at the run time
     * can run the the applicaiton as long as application is dowloaded
6. What are micro-services & web-services
   https://www.parasoft.com/blog/web-api-vs-web-services-microservices-basics-differences/
   * A microservice is a small, independent, application that performs a highly focused service as well as possible.
     * Archietureal style 
     * ![](micro-servesles.png)
     * ![](api-microservices.png)
   * A web service is an internet-based interface that makes the “services” of one application available to applications running on different platforms. 
     * A web service is a set of interfaces that define the functionality of an application.
     * ![](/rest-api.png)
   * API stands for Application Programming Interface.
    * ![](api.png)
7. What Java JIT compiler is?
    * JIT
     * Just in time compilation
     * compiles the application at the build time
     * browser need to download the compiler to compile the application at the run time
     * compiler is over 1 megabytes
8.  What IoC (inversion of control) is?
     * https://www.baeldung.com/inversion-control-and-dependency-injection-in-spring
     * Instead user instanciate a object(for exmple,dabase connection jpa, spring jpa create the Entitymanager for caller to use to do query or transaction ).framework will create the object for you.
     * Inversion of control is a software design principle that asserts a program can benefit in terms of pluggability, testability, usability and loose coupling if the management of an application's flow is transferred to a different part of the application.
     * The Inversion-of-Control (IoC) pattern, is about providing any kind of callback (which controls reaction), instead of acting ourself directly (in other words, inversion and/or redirecting control to external handler/controller). The Dependency-Injection (DI) pattern is a more specific version of IoC pattern, and is all about removing dependencies from your code.
   * 


9.  What Spring boot is?
10. Describe hibernate ORM
11. Asked what dependency injection is
12. Asked about SQL & general experience with it
13. Difference between collections & streams
14. Difference between Linked List & Array List
15. Can entity classes be marked as final?
16. Is “finally” guaranteed to run?
17. Can you override a private or static method in Java?
    * No, we cannot override private or static methods in Java.
    * Private methods in Java are not visible to any other class which limits their scope to the class in which they are declared.
18. Asked about RESTful API
19. Asked about what kind of exceptions I can expect to see thrown when comparing strings 
with like .compareTo() & .equals()
20. Asked about @SpringBootApplication annotation
