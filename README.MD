#### Iaas vs Paas vs Saas?
* -> Ease of use increases
* -> Complexity decreases
* Iaas == Leasing a car()
  * you can choose color specs
  * you focus more what you want
  * but you have restrictions(mileage, fuel, etc)
* Paas == Car rental
  * you not really care the color specs 
  * more concerned about the price, size, specs you need
* Saas == Uber or Lyft
  * you not really care the color specs 
  * You are not driving or pay the gas.
* ![](saas-iaas-paas.png)
* Developer only focus on Application and Data
* Vendor focus on infrastructure and services
  * Serves
  * storage
